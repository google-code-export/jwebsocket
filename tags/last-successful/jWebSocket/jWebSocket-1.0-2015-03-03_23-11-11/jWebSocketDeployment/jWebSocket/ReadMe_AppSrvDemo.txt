The jWebSocketAppSvrDemo-<ver>.war requires the jWebSockerServer-Bundle-<ver>.jar
as well as the jWebSocketTomcatEngine-<ver>.jar to be located in Tomcat's /lib folder.
You can use the jWebSocket.xml configuration file either in Tomcat's /conf
folder or in %JWEBSOCKET_HOME%/conf.
Please copy the jWebSocketAppSrvDemo-<ver>.war file to Tomcat's /webapps folder 
to be auto-deployed or deploy it manually as described in the quick guide 
at http://jwebsocket.org.
