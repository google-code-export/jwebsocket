The jWebSocketJetty.war demonstrates the jWebSocket Framework in cooperation with the Jetty Engine.
This project defaults to listen on port 80 and port 443 for http and ws or https and wss respectively.
If you run an Apache WebServer listening on the same ports you need to shut it down to test this demo.
Please also refer to the details at http://jwebsocket.org.
